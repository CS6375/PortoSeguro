\section{Related Work}

Machine learning techniques have been widely used in the field of car insurance to help the insurance companies in predicting the customers' choices in order to provide more competitive services. Related works concerned following topics.

\subsubsection{Insurance Purchase Prediction}

Asma S Alshamsi \cite{alshamsi2014predicting} built a classification model based on random forest that could be applied in predicting which of the insurance policies would likely to be chosen by the customers. Saba Arslan Shah and Mehreen Saeed \cite{shahpredicting} gave an overview of the methodology developed for predicting the purchased policy for a
customer (in a Kaggle hosted competition \cite{kaggle:allstatepurchase}), using logistic regression, naive Bayes, SVM and random forest.

\subsubsection{Drive Style Modeling}
\cite{dong2016characterizing}, \cite{nikulin2016driving} analyzed `good' and `bad' drivers' driving style using unsupervised learning and deep learning with vehicle
sensor data, e.g., GPS.
\cite{singhusing} used Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to perform deep learning on an image dataset  of drivers in their
cars performing specific actions, trying to identify the \emph{unsafe} actions of a driver.

\subsubsection{Claim Prediction}

Dal Pozzolo et al. \cite{dal2010comparison} surveyed many popular machine learning models' performance on claim prediction. The technique and measure metric (Gini index) used in their paper were very similar to ours, and greatly inspired our progess. \cite{huangfu2015data} gave a full report about yet another Kaggle hosted competition Allstate Claim Prediction Challenge\cite{kaggle:allstate}.
