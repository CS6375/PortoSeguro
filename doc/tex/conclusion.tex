\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

In this report, we first formally defined the \emph{Porto Seguro's Safe Driver
Prediction} problems we were trying to tackle with. Then we gave an overview of
our approach's methodology toward the problem, include algorithm description,
evaluation metrics, preprocessing phase, training phase and result analysis.
Multiple models were used in our experiment and their performances were
compared.
