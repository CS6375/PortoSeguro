\section{Feature Analysis and Engineering}

The data comes in the traditional Kaggle form of one training and test file
each: \lstinline{train.csv} and \lstinline{test.csv}. Each row corresponds to a
specific policy holder and the columns describe their features. The target
variable is named \lstinline{target} here and it indicates whether this policy
holder made an insurance claim in the past.
